Prior to NYCHA, Bomee designed and led the climate mitigation and adaptation programs of the New York office of  Enterprise Community Partners, Inc., including securing New York City's adoption of the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria as its green standard for affordable housing, and designing Enterprise's post-Sandy resiliency initiative to build climate adaptation capacity of multifamily affordable housing owners. In 2003, Bomee co-founded GreenHomeNYC, Inc., a volunteer-driven nonprofit that brings professional green-building knowledge to lay audiences while supporting new entrants to green careers. In her first career, she developed Internet-based applications for digital agencies and start-ups.
